# Modeling-Analysis
Modeling Analysis codes from Villanova University

These are my codes from one of my more difficult coding courses at Villanova University, called Modeling Analyis.
Each topic covered one week, with which we were expected to write codes to solve multiple problems, and then write a report encompassing our findings.
Reports will also be included as PDFs.
